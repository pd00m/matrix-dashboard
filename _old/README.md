## Raspberry PI initial set up

1. Run Raspberry Pi Imager for PI OS Lite

**The following steps are not necessary. This can be done in the imager configuration settings**

2. Add a blank `ssh` file in the root directory after install
3. Add a new file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` in the root folder with the contents below

```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
    psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
}
```

## SSH into your PI

## Installation instructions

(copy and paste the below until a requirements txt is made)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pillow -y

```
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/jh442/matrix-dashboard.git
sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7
sudo pip install python-dateutil
sudo pip install numpy
sudo apt install libopenblas-dev pkg-config libopenblas-dev
sudo apt install gfortran
sudo pip3 install scipy
sudo pip3 install pyowm
sudo pip3 install websocket_client
sudo pip3 install spotipy
sudo pip3 install garminconnect
sudo pip3 install rgbmatrix
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Create the config.ini file

This must be made in the root of the project for the credentials

1. cat > config.ini and paste your passwords.

**If issues with scipy install, use**
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-scipy

## clone rgb matrix into dir

1.  git clone https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.git to download the content into the folder
2.  cd in rpi-rgp-led-matrix
3.  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pillow -y
4.  make build-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)
5.  sudo make install-python PYTHON=$(command -v python3)
6.  Switch off on-board sound (`dtparam=audio=off` in `/boot/config.txt`)
7.  reboot

## Turn off the audio warning

There is a good chance you will get the following error

```
=== snd_bcm2835: found that the Pi sound module is loaded. ===
Don't use the built-in sound of the Pi together with this lib; it is known to be
incompatible and cause trouble and hangs (you can still use external USB sound adapters).
```

I found the best way to disable this was the following:

```
cd ../..
cd /etc/modprobe.d
sudo nano raspi-blacklist.conf
blacklist snd_bcm2835
```

exit and then `sudo reboot`

Once starting, the last step should be to navigate to the spotify section. It will ask for a URL. Click it, and then paste
the entire URL from the web browser it opened in the SSH session terminal. This should authenticate the app

On a headless unit with Spotipy, it was needed to leverage the following code

self.auth_manager = spotipy.SpotifyOAuth(
scope=scope, open_browser=False
)

## To run

1. CD into `/matrix-dashboard/impl`
2. `sudo python3 controller_v3.py`
